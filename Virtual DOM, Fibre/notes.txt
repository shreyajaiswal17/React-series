createRoot creates a Virtual DOM then it matches with the main DOM and his (virtual)DOM (mai fibre)then updates only those jaha changes hue hai


BUT OUR BROWSER clears the whole stuf and paints again(as in pura structure tyar hota haii) ==  this is known as reloading


# REACT FIBRE- breaking down rendering process into small chunks and updating according to schedule

ITS working behind the virtual dom now
Goal , key featurs = pause, abort or reuse work , assign priority 


# RECONCILIATION 

Reconsider all the changes , diff one tree with another to determine the changes
it is the algo behind what is popularly understood as Virtual DOM


# UPDATE

A change in data used to render a React app. usually the result of 'setState'
